                <p>After all the talk of mass communication, society, social standings and politics, one may lose
                    hope with regards to the meaning of a true democracy– which in turn leads to a more negative
                    perspective to the future of communication. And what of the current state of mass communication now?
                    How were constraints regarding societal standing dealt with in terms of the majority’s capabilities
                    to be vocal in the media? Don’t we all get a say too?
                </p>
                <p>The experience of a true democracy is barred because of the very standards and restrictions the
                    society has imposed on the people. With the emergence of the idea of the anti-theory, which was
                    delineated by Daniel Bell, there sparked a hope for a more veracious democracy– one where anybody,
                    no matter what class or standard, would have the benefit of enjoying mass media genuinely.
                </p>
                <p>Although the theory is well-thought of and has a good scheme to help our society’s mass media now, it
                    has downsides that are affected by how our society works today. We have become so systematized that
                    the hierarchies we constructed have caused huge rifts and advantages to those who are in higher
                    social standings, hence the repeated fact that their lives are just that much more advantageous than
                    the masses. Albeit the downsides pointing to those in power having more control as producers of
                    information and entertainment, with the idea of mass-mediation becoming our culture, we are free to
                    exercise our capabilities to choose for ourselves. A change in scenery, especially that in mass
                    media, would cause uproars and contests from those above, for sure. However, I believe it opens up
                    the constraints that have tied down our community’s democracy to mere conformity to traditions.
                </p>
                <p>Following the evolution of human society, especially through the means of industrialization, it is
                    apparent that the majority now have more power than ever. For instance, as an individual that can
                    enjoy mass media however I want, I can choose whether to subscribe to platforms which suit my
                    interest solely because of my own choice and preference. Sure, I may get influenced by what’s
                    popular and more sought after, but at the end of the day, I get the freedom to choose, because I
                    can. We, as people of a crowd and society, no longer have to adhere to societal standards and
                    conducts. On that premise, we were never “required” in the first place, but being the social
                    creatures we are, we have had the desire to conform anyway, so we could fit in with the world that
                    we live in and share with others in the masses.
                </p>
                <p>In spite of being people that usually conform to the crowd, to tradition, and to standards already
                    set by the society, we are also our own people. In accordance with that fact, to which I share the
                    same sentiments, Edward Shils further explains that we not only have the power to now incorporate
                    the opinions of the majority into society, but as well as our own individual beliefs. This is
                    another reminder that we are not just a part of a group or a community; we are also one and
                    ourselves, with the capacity to think and make judgments. With these capabilities, critic’s can be
                    made not by groups, but with our own individual selves. With this big step in mass mediation,
                    modernization has now led to the establishment of an average man and woman, which now disregards the
                    problems that arose with hierarchy and social standing, and the advancement in mass communication,
                    which also immensely helps the efficient configuration of culture and history. The modes of
                    socializing have evolved since we do not rely on those above us to discern what we want and how we
                    want to live.
                </p>
                <p>I suppose now, with the technological and societal advancements the world has undergone, mass
                    communication and media are in a better place than that of the past, considering we are, by all
                    means, not just passive audiences to mass media, but active consumers as well. Mass media should be
                    catered to all, and not just to the rich and privileged. The shackles that have constrained our own
                    freedoms to criticize and choose as part of the majority have been lifted, even if just a little,
                    and this development can help mass communication go even further.
