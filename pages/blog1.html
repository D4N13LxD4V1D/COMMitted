                <p><b>In the historical periods, the mob was nothing but unculturedness and riots.</b> Yet the mass
                    fills up most of the community, and to De Tocqueville, it is the inside of society--the heart. With
                    this knowledge, the mass discovered newfound power and wealth. Finally, find themselves holding
                    their freedom. However, what lifts them also beats them. As they hold the freedom to dictate and
                    proclaim, they have a democracy that pushes them toward self-destructiveness. They do not label
                    themselves enslaved, knowing they keep that distinct sense of freedom.
                </p>
                <p>Nonetheless, the majority's will is always ruled by quantity and quality. A perfect portrayal is
                    during elections, especially in the Philippines' recent May presidential election. "Majority wins,"
                    people state these days when a group becomes divided to a decision. The reality is that not
                    everything the majority decides is proper. It is engraved in their minds that equality is a must,
                    even when it is not. The desire to try to equalize everything results in standardizing everything
                    too. In the presence of uniformity, uniqueness is nowhere in sight.
                </p>
                <p>Moreover, as the tyrant legitimizes and is in position, no one can make the majority admit they are
                    mistaken. It is up to the people to decide on their own, but if one is presented with facts and data
                    and still proceeds to believe what is not deserving, the problems are themselves. Reasons will arise
                    in parts that do not make sense before, but to them, it does to justify their choice. The same goes
                    for the recent Philippines election, how people explained their favored candidate based on their
                    family, fame, or appearance. To La Boetie, cultural pessimism is a state of moral failure. As
                    carelessness surfaces, it is complicit with tyranny, and all ends as a democratic disease.
                </p>
                <p>Because of the will to balance all, dividing standardization and homogenization is unattainable.
                    There is no space to be out of the norm while controlling even certain conditions of life results in
                    the homogenization of exploitation. Struggles like ignoring the worsening traffic that hinders one
                    from being present at work on time or working almost half a day to live should not be a standard if
                    we think of it; however, now it is. It proves Tocqueville's statement that the masses do not think
                    for themselves and go where the known majority are just because they are there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As well as individuals, according to Mill, are selfish since people want to be free but only go
                    after what benefits their own needs. No one can take out the "mass" in mass society, and
                    similarities do not mean unity. One must realize collective awareness to figure out what to fight
                    for and how to fight for equality. This mindset can change homogenization from Mill's viewpoint.
                </p>
                <p>As a result, the mass becomes collective mediocrity. The real power is not visible in the masses as
                    being elite is not present within.
