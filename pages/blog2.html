                <p>Le Bon views the masses in a very negative light, adapting the term ‘crowd’ with the idea of
                    mob in mind. Mobs could be bad, indeed. I remembered our quantitative research way back in Grade 12
                    about ‘keyboard justice’ where we examined the relationship between Gen Z’s exposure to social media
                    and their tendency to engage in online mob justice. We found that a Gen Z with high exposure to
                    social media platforms is indeed more likely to participate in online mobbing (exposing, bullying,
                    doxxing, etc.) as an informal way of acquiring justice. This serves as an example of how media and
                    its forms are continuously evolving, and how mass media today does not simply refer to the mass
                    production of newspapers or broadcasting of news in the television, but also social media platforms
                    in the internet. Going back to the idea of ‘mass’ in mass media, Le Bon may have been right in his
                    argument, or at least made some sense as it could be applied to some contexts; however as Freud
                    stressed, social dimension should always be present.
                </p>
                <div class="gallery">

                    <img src="img/blog2/3.png" alt="le bon" />
                </div>
                <p>Now, I think it should be noted that I am not a fan of Freud and his other psychological arguments,
                    but in this one, I agree with him. Le Bon would view rallies and protests as politically regressive.
                    To him, mass movements are nothing but primitive acts that take us back to the dark past. However,
                    as Freud said, social contexts should always be considered. The masses should not be viewed in a
                    vacuum because it consists of diverse people with diverse experiences and backgrounds. Not everyone
                    is a privileged whiny Gen Z who wants to cancel someone on social media. Some, if not most of the
                    masses, are underprivileged and underrepresented lower classes who have to make noise for them to be
                    heard. It is only easy to view their efforts and movements as a nuisance when we do not understand
                    their contexts. Regarding them as primitive is dismissive to their struggles and is not very
                    progressive for our society. Personally, I am someone from the middle class but I stand with the
                    lower class to fully engulf myself in the masses. Even if we cannot physically join their struggles,
                    we should still exert our utmost understanding and respect for them— beside them is where we should
                    stand.
                </p>

                <p>But not everyone who is oppressed sides with their people. Reich made a great point when he asked how
                    Hitler and Stalin alone were able to control millions of people, and made even a greater insight
                    when he used a sociological lens to examine the psychology of the people and found man’s tendency to
                    submit to authority. Back then, I became distasteful of the people who explicitly sided with the
                    oppressors. Now, I understand that not everyone is capable of standing with the masses especially if
                    it is their life on the line. For example, talented artists who chose to draw oppressors like the
                    aforementioned ones in order to have food on the table. These people, as we see, have no other
                    choice but to submit to the authority of the oppressors as not everyone can afford to be martyrs for
                    their principles. Nevertheless, those of us who can, should still stand with the masses, and I mean
                    not succumbing to elitism and absolutism which banishes people who simply have no other option. In
                    order to truly stand with the masses, we should carefully discern and recognize that the enemies
                    will always be the big people, and the small people who seem to be swayed by them are only victims
                    like us.
                </p>

                    <img src="img/blog2/7.png" alt="reich" />
                </div>
                <p>For so long, I believed that being silent means siding with the oppressors. As mentioned earlier,
                    there are people who have no choice but to bend their principles, but there are also people who do
                    not wish to explicitly bend theirs, hence they embrace silence instead. Tarde focused on this
                    consequence when he examined the evolution of media and the mass that comes with it. The masses
                    evolved and have become the public whose beliefs shape public opinion. We are able to form these
                    opinions by gathering information from mass media and carefully deliberating them. However, if the
                    oppressors have one big fear, it is the masses gaining information, realizing their atrocities, and
                    turning against them. In order to suppress this, the oppressors control the information that gets to
                    the public by silencing media outlets, or taunting people until they silence themselves. Now, could
                    we blame journalists for lying low during a dictator’s term because they are breadwinners and their
                    demise would lead to their family hitting rock bottom? Could we blame someone for being silent on
                    political issues due to lack of knowledge because his parents were not able to send him to school
                    and are far more concerned on what they would eat tomorrow? For me, no we could and should not. As I
                    said earlier, all of us smaller people are only victims by the bigger enemies. Indeed, it is
                    saddening that some people have to embrace silence, but that does not mean that each one of us
                    should. Just because we learn that it is morally acceptable does not mean that we should cease our
                    efforts because at the end of the day, those who still have their voices should do their best to
                    amplify the calls of the less heard.
                </p>

                <p>Since we have tackled evolution, Tönnies identified two types of collectives that oppose each other
                    in the modern mass. First is the community who believes in the unity of thoughts and emotions, but
                    is most of the time ruled by the latter. While this may be ideal in keeping a close and intimate
                    interpersonal relationship, it is not appropriate to bigger contexts. On the other hand, society
                    believes in the separation of sentiment and reason, and is most likely dominated by the latter.
                    Leaders, especially Machiavellians might behave this way in order to manage a bigger group of people
                    better, but is it actually better to become indifferent to the pains of the people in exchange for a
                    developed economy? Can good governance not come with empathy? This is a question that lingered in my
                    mind for so long, but in the end I figured that the world is not black and white and we should not
                    become absolutists obsessed with dichotomies. Instead of picking a side, we should be able to create
                    a synthesis where we balance both reason and sentiment. If we get stuck debating and picking sides,
                    we can never reach an equilibrium that will propel us to justice and progress.

                </div>
                <p>In conclusion, where I stand and where I believe we should stand is with the masses. The crowd, the
                    public, the masses and the people in it are neither positive nor negative, neither good nor bad. It
                    is a collection of diverse individuals who are all unique from each other, but held together by the
                    same struggle.
