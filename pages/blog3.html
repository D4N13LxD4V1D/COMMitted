                <p><b>Ortega y Gasset states that one cannot avoid the crowd for it is always here,</b> and it grows
                    more powerful as time passes. Technological advancements have resulted in the crowds invading the
                    upper section of the social hierarchy, creating more possibilities for richer lives. It is also true
                    in the contemporary time: common people vying for politics, generation Z’s main goal is becoming a
                    professional to earn more money (myself included), and learning how to invest stocks in the business
                    world. Through the lens of the crowd, this is a good thing. For the elites? It is a nightmare.
                </p>
                <p>The elites have always reserved high culture as their own, and when the crowd began to invade this
                    distinction, the elites were enraged. They tag the masses as pretentious, saying that the masses can
                    only purchase art, but they will never understand it. <b>Elitism</b> is what you call it. I am
                    reminded of a post on Twitter that went viral years ago. It was already taken down when I tried to
                    search for it but to give the gist of the tweet, the user said “<i>caviar</i> haters do not know the
                    true taste of fine dining because they were not born to experience fine dining,” while quoting
                    another tweet by a user that was criticizing <i>caviar</i>. <i>Caviar</i> is a very expensive dish
                    and it is popular among the elites. Personally, I find it absurd. I mean, why would you want to eat
                    unfertilized fish eggs? Elites would literally do anything just to reserve their high culture
                    despite the outrageous prices that come with it. This is also seen in museums. The masses can only
                    view art but they cannot take it home. Why? Because the art is owned by the elites. They limit the
                    crowd’s enjoyment by gatekeeping the art. Whether they do it for an ego boost or for future
                    investments, we’ll never know. One thing is for sure, this discrimination amongst people who were
                    not born with a golden spoon further supports Ortega’s view regarding the elites’ reservation of
                    high culture and in turn, art becomes D E H U M A N I Z E D.
                </p>
                <p>Goebbels then argued that modern art was not art because it is seen without culture. For Spengler,
                    art has soul. It is similar to history. <i>When culture degenerates, all of civilization falls
                        apart.</i> History is nothing without culture. Just like now, when historical revisionism is
                    spreading like wildfire, the people who shed blood to protect our motherland in the past are being
                    captured in oblivion. They are being shunned in an attempt to cancel out the cause of bloodshed, but
                    of course, we should #NeverForget. The cultural, socio-political, economic contexts of the lived
                    experiences of the people are important because these give significance to the soul of history.
                    Basically, <b>Art = History = Culture = Context.</b>
                </p>
                <p>Spengler also mentioned the cause of death of Western culture: democracy and technology. Democracy in
                    its modern form kills true freedom. It is the concept of bandwagon in a nutshell— true individualism
                    is killed for the sake of equality (suddenly, we are back in politics discovering the masses!).
                    Technology, on the other hand, destroys the unity of knowledge because of technology’s limitations.
                    It is a pseudo-fatalist approach— when there are pros, there are surely cons!
                </p>
                <p>The long history of the masses’ struggle has led to the social hierarchy crumbling down. The poor are
                    becoming rich, the masses are having more power, and the elites are infuriated. Although these
                    social transformations are emerging, we must never forget that the fight does not end here. The 1%
                    elites still hold the majority of power, and the majority of the masses are still treated as the
                    minority. Remembering our history with its respective contexts can be the fire that can burn down
                    the elites’ iron vaults.
