                <p>Indeed, the media, the public, and its surrounding concepts, went through such a long history.
                    It was guarded and viewed differently as researchers and scholars critiqued and passed by. As
                    dissected, its elements and constituents shed light on deeper and further understanding and
                    comprehension, grasping the influence and role of the mass to mass media and mass media’s role in
                    return. Once again, going back, we remember that the “mass” or the general public is far from just a
                    blank rowdy crowd. There is always a context to equate in every mass behavior; there is psychology
                    to unpack in this collectivity and its individuality within. Moreover, the crowd, apart from being
                    psychological, is also sociological, as Reich stated. Moving forward, as technology (thank God for
                    these instruments and mediums) advanced and mass beliefs and the widespread of opinion dissemination
                    evolved to our now-called mass media.
                </p>
                <p>These new technologies have also enabled the mass to live richer and wealthier lives due to new
                    opportunities and possibilities. On the other hand, reserved spaces for creative minorities have
                    been seized and overruled, as further expounded a while back, the rise of the so-called ‘high
                    culture’― elitism at its core. Thus, we can see how mass media alongside impacted and marked
                    culture. Given all these theories and premises surrounding the society, its negatives and downsides
                    affirm real democracy. The anti-theory states that people’s enjoyment of mass media as authentic
                    culture gives hope for the long-assumed democracy. Now, as mass media is everywhere, we can see and
                    understand not only how it is channeled, propagated, and produced. All the more, we can analyze and
                    give light on why and how we consume this culture, looking through its context.
                </p>
                <p>With all of these, we have seen and are continually witnessing how the media and the masses together
                    are continually evolving and shaping our culture today. In the same way, it also fuels and evolves
                    our commitment not only to proper communication but also to effective communication. These,
                    moreover, would be means of elevating the condition of the society and its betterment. The role of
                    communication plays great significance in mass media and cultivating culture. We aim and aspire for
                    effectiveness and efficaciousness of communication where information, correlation, entertainment,
                    and such are produced and consumed by the people. We have come so far looking back to the past, from
                    a negative outlook towards the masses to now with it being ubiquitous as integrated by media such
                    that creating impact on the public. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go, and there are
                    more to fight and engage within our society. Thus, we recognize and hold on to the importance of
                    media and communication as critical tools to assist us in these fights.
